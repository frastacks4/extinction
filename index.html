			<p>A saber-toothed cat (alternatively spelled sabre-toothed cat) is any member of various extinct groups of predatory mammals that were characterized by long, curved saber-shaped canine teeth. The saber-toothed cats were found worldwide from the Eocene epoch to the end of the Pleistocene epoch (42 mya â€“ 11,000 years ago), existing for about 42 million years.</p>
			<h3>Title</h3>
			<p>One of the best known genera is Smilodon, species of which, especially S. fatalis, are popularly referred as a "saber-toothed tiger," a genus within the subfamily Machairodontinae of the carnivoran family Felidae.</p>
			<h2>Title</h2>	
			<p>However, usage of the word cat is a misnomer, as most saber-toothed "cats" are not closely related to modern cats of Felidae: instead, many are members of other feliform carnivoran families, such as Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae;[5][6] the oxyaenid "creodont" genera Machaeroides and Apataelurus; and two lineages of metatherian mammals, the thylacosmilids of Sparassodonta, and deltatheroideans, which are more closely related to marsupials than to the placental mammals of the other orders mentioned.</p>
			<h3>Title</h3>
			<p>These subfamilies evolved their saber-toothed characteristics entirely independently. They are most known for having maxillary canines which extended down from the mouth even when the mouth was closed. Saber-toothed cats were generally more robust than today's cats and were quite bear-like in build.</p>
